								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<p>Hello, my name is Daniel Hong and thank you for taking the time to visit my portfolio! I am a self-taught full stack software engineer that is passionate about creating useful and tangible products, as well as constantly seeking new knowledge and skills. I began my journey into software engineering in 2022 driven by my curiosity of the inner workings of things, as well as a love of creating aything elegant and functional. Through hours of self-study, I have become proficient in JavaScript, as well as familiar with libraries and frameworks such as Node.js, Express, and React. </p>
								<p>In my free time, I enjoy anything that provides a creative outlet or anything that pushes my physical boundaries. In particular, I enjoy cooking, mixology, golfing, and weightlifting. If you’re interested in learning more about me, please feel free to contact me through the information provided in the “Contact” section.</p>
